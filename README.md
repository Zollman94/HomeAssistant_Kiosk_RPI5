# **HomeAssistant Kiosk on Raspberry Pi 5**  
> **Guide to set up a kiosk using Raspberry Pi 5 and iiyama PLT1700 touch screen monitor**

## **🛠️ Requirements**
- **Raspberry Pi 5**  
- **Power supply** (5V, 3A)  
- **Touchscreen monitor**: iiyama PLT1700  
- **Cables**:  
  - USB A to USB B (for touch)  
  - HDMI/DVI/VGA to MicroHDMI (for video)

## **📥 Install Raspberry Pi OS**
1. Download and install **Raspberry Pi Imager** from the [official website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).  
2. Use the imager to install:  
   **Raspberry Pi OS Full (64-bit)** with **desktop environment**.  
3. Boot up the Raspberry Pi and connect the iiyama PLT1700 monitor.  
4. Open a terminal and run the following commands to update the system:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   sudo apt install git
   sudo apt install p7zip-full
   ```

---

## **🖥️ Verify Touchscreen Connection**
To ensure the Raspberry Pi recognizes the iiyama touchscreen, run:  
```bash
dmesg | grep -i touch
```
If the touchscreen is detected, you will see relevant logs in the output.

## **📦 Install Touchscreen Drivers**
### **Option 1: Download from official website**  
Download the latest drivers from the official EETI website:  
🔗 [Download Linux Drivers](https://www.eeti.com/drivers_Linux.html)  

> **Important:** Ensure you download the driver for the **ARM architecture**.  

### **Option 2: Use the pre-downloaded version from this repository**  
If the official website is down, you can use the driver included in this repository.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zollman94/HomeAssistant_Kiosk_RPI5.git
cd HomeAssistant_Kiosk_RPI5
7z x eGTouch_v2.5.13219.L-ma.7z
cd eGTouch_v2.5.13219.L-ma
```

---

## **🚀 Install the Driver**
1. Make the installation script executable:  
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x setup.sh
   ```
2. Run the installer script as **sudo** and follow the on-screen instructions:  
   ```bash
   sudo ./setup.sh
   ```

> **Note:** This script will guide you through the driver installation process.  

3. **Reboot the system** to apply changes:  
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

---

## **🖐️ Test Touchscreen**
After reboot, you can test if the touchscreen is working properly.  

Run the following command to manually start the touchscreen service:  
```bash
cd /usr/bin
sudo ./eGTouchD
```

> If the touchscreen responds, then the driver is working correctly.  

---

## **⚙️ Enable Touchscreen on Boot**
To ensure that the touchscreen service starts automatically on boot, you need to create a **systemd service**.  

1. Create a new systemd service file:  
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/egettouchd.service
   ```

2. Paste the following configuration into the file:  
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Start eGTouchD on boot
   After=multi-user.target

   [Service]
   Type=forking
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/eGTouchD
   User=root
   Group=root
   RemainAfterExit=yes
   StandardOutput=journal
   StandardError=journal

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

> **Explanation of Key Settings:**  
- `Type=forking`: This is used if the process "forks" (detaches from the terminal) to run in the background.  
- `RemainAfterExit=yes`: Ensures the service is considered "active" even if the process exits.  

---

## **🔄 Apply the Service Configuration**
Run the following commands to reload the systemd daemon, restart the service, and check its status:  
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart egettouchd.service
sudo systemctl status egettouchd.service
```

You should see **"Active: active (running)"** in the service status.  

---

## **🎉 Finished!**
Now your Raspberry Pi 5 with iiyama PLT1700 touchscreen will automatically start the touchscreen service after each reboot.  
If you encounter any issues, check the service logs with:  
```bash
journalctl -u egettouchd.service -e
```
